                        <p>For kindergarten children, we know it can be hard to stay focused and to learn new things like reading or counting. In the times that we live in, these children may find it difficult to concentrate on classic learning games. Thus the idea of creating a new interactive game using computers appeared.</p>

                        <p>The question we asked ourselves is how to interest a 5-year-old child in learning to count. The current methods that are used are abacus or to simply learn with their fingers. These methods can end up being boring, hence losing their focus.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, if no one is behind them to check what they are doing, they can very quickly make a mistake without realizing it. To do this, using a computer or something interactive with children could improve their concentration, and it can also correct its errors.</p>

                        <p>We struggled to find any related work, there is some work about the benefits of computer aided education, but unfortunately nothing using tangible devices. The work of Zaranis et al. [1] presents some work on a tablet, while the study found that using tablet computers with numeracy-focused software improves children's early math skills, it did so using only software.</p>

                        <p>We proposed a new simple game consisting of a box with buttons and LEDs as well as a monitor (computer giving instructions). </p>
                        <p>The idea is to capture their attention as much as possible.</p>
                        <p>First, with instructions that are given on the computer rather than on paper. It can be digital numbers, numbers with hands or numbers with dices. (See Figure n°)</p>
                        <p>In addition, colored LEDs are added on the box. There are two columns of 10 LEDs. We choose to put 10 LEDs rather than 9 because kindergarten children have difficulties understanding that 10 units is equal to 1 ten. (See Figure n°)</p>
                        <p>The incrementation of the counter/LEDs is done using arcade buttons.</p>
                        <p>Finally, when validating the result, a funny image is displayed on the screen to encourage children to play again.</p>

                        <p>We tested our game in a kindergarten class (around 5 / 6 years old) for one day. </p>
                        <p>We wanted to watch 4 things: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>if the children were more focused and entertained.</li>
                            <li>compare this method with classical methods like abacus or counting with hands.</li>
                            <li>watch the performance of the children.</li>
                            <li>how high a student can count with each method.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We take the children in groups of 3 such that they are not intimidated, and try to make groups with the same level of counting. </p>

                            <p>We were able to observe during this day that on average, the children were less dispersed with the educational games on computers than with the classic games. (4 other games to learn how to read and write were installed next to our new counting game). Maybe because each child can be in ”his own bubble”, instead of being at a table with others. and also because children don’t need to be corrected by the teacher since the computer makes it automatically. </p>

                        <h2 id="conclusion">9. Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>There are not many studies of interactive educational devices for children. With this project we wanted to contribute to that field and provide an innovative way for kindergarten children to learn how to count. Our small experimental trial confirmed our intuition, the game captured the attention of the children and helped them to stay focused on the exercise provided. The device could also benefit from a small upgrade, namely a counter (a 7-segment display) next to the rows of LEDs, so that there is a direct (and instantaneous) feedback for the user. </p>
                        <p>Our device does not aim at replacing the other learning methods. It is to be seen as a complementary device. The multitude of encoding (learning) methods is what makes the learning process efficient. For the children to learn efficiently, they need to be exposed to the same information, presented differently. For instance with an abacus or a numerical chart next to the device. </p>
                        <p>To further confirm this first result a follow-up study would be interesting to conduct. This time with a larger population and over a longer period of time.</p>
